	COOKIE POLICY<br>
What is a cookie?<br>

Cookies are small strings of text exchanged between a website and the user’s browsing browser, each time you access an Internet site. These strings, which do not contain any executable code, are used for different activities, such as performing automatic authentication, keeping track of sessions, storing information to improve the surfing of the site or the user’s browsing experience. Each domain visited through a browser can set one or more cookies. An Internet page can contain objects that come from many different domains and each of them can set cookies (in this case called “third-party cookies”). The use of cookies improves the browsing experience on the website and can keep the chosen settings during Your next visit.<br>

The general provision of the Garante Privacy (GU No. 126 of 3 June 2014) defines two types of cookies:<br>

Technical cookies – Used for the sole purpose of allowing the transmission of a communication, to complete a service requested by the user or to perform statistical research.<br>
Profiling cookies – Used to record the behaviour of a user and the expressed preferences in order to send advertising messages in line with his profile.<br>
 

TENDERCAPITAL LTD, for its website, uses the following cookies:<br>

Functional (first party)<br>
These cookies allow the correct operation of some parts of the site. These cookies are stored in the browser; it is possible to cancel or disable their reception, yet compromising the functionality of some services on the website. The user can change the cookie reception setting by changing its storage settings as described in the “How to disable cookies?” section of this statement.<br>
Analytics (third party)<br>
Google Analytics is a free tool for web analysing by Google that mainly allows to gather information (such as, information on the visited pages, the time spent on the site, the way the site has been reached in and whatever was clicked by the user while browsing our pages) anonymously and to report websites’ trends without identifying individual visitors. You can view the privacy policies of Google at the following link: <br>http://www.google.it/intl/it/policies/privacy/<br>
Social Plugins and Widgets (third party)<br>
Our web pages may contain plug-ins of the most popular social networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin) managed by third parties. Such plug-ins could, for example, correspond to Facebook’s “Like” buttons or Twitter’s “Retweet” buttons. If you access to one of our web pages, equipped with a similar plug-in, the internet browser connects directly to the third-party servers and the plug-in is displayed on the screen thanks to the connection with the browser. The plug-in might communicate to third-party servers whose pages the user has visited. If a social network user visits our web pages while logged in its account, this information might be associated with the account itself. Even if you use the plug-in functions (for example, by clicking the “Like” button), the information will be associated with the account.<br>

With regards to third-party cookies, we refer to the following pages for the description of their purposes and the possibility of disabling them:<br>
